            NICHE.</p>
        <p>The University campus at Kumaracoil, Thuckalay in Kanyakumari District of Tamilnadu is in the serene

            Padmanabhapuram Palace. It is only 1.5 km interior towards the foothills of the mountains from Kumaracoil
            Junction
            on the Kanyakumari Thiruvanthapuram National Highway
            (NH-47)-about 30 km from Kanyakumari and 60 km from Trivandrum, the capital city of the state of Kerala.</p>
        <p>Noorul Islam College of Engineering, the constituent teaching unit of Noorul Islam University was established
            in the year 1989-90, with the approval of All India Council for Technical Education and started offering two
            engineering courses, namely, B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering and B.E. in Electronics and
            Communication
            Engineering with 40 students in each course. Since then the college has registered continuous growth in
            academic
            activities by offering more and new Engineering and Technology courses with development of required
            infrastructure facilities such as building,
            library, faculty, computers and relevant latest software and peripherals, equipment etc.</p>
        <p>The educational institution – Noorul Islam College of Engineering - established with a humble beginning in
            the year
            1989 with two undergraduate engineering programs with an intake capacity of 80 students,
            has now metamorphosed itself into one of the great and best educational institutions in southern part of

        <p>The Noorul Islam College of Engineering, now, having attained the status of University, its responsibilities
            have
            become manifold and vision broadened and mission lengthened. The challenge that we have at hand now is the

            the industry and community, imparting expertise in essential areas and achieving excellence are the
            hallmarks of a university. The Noorul Islam Centre for Higher Education, besides achieving these hallmarks
